# Intrusion_Detection_System

- Used the CICIDS 2017 dataset that contains many types of cybercrime. 
- This approach involves preprocessing of the dataset using min-max normalization, reducing data using the principal component analysis algorithm, and classifying benign and Denial of Service (DOS) attacks using Multinomial Naive Bayes. 
- Finally, assessed the effectiveness of the model using a confusion matrix and found that it can be used to accurately detect zero-day attacks. 
- As cyber threats become more sophisticated, there is a continued need for the development and improvement of IDSs to safeguard the CIA of information. 
- The goal for the future is to use an advanced hybrid machine learning model like a combination of Neural Networks and Decision Trees to achieve a higher level of accuracy and efficiency in detecting zero-day attacks.
